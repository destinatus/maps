## Overview
Interactive web application for visualizing cellular tower sites across the US with:
- Real-time mapping of cell sites
- Technology filtering (LTE, 5G, mmWave)
- Site-specific details and alerts
- Work task management integration

## Components

### Frontend (React)
- **Map View**: Interactive Leaflet map showing cell sites with technology-specific icons
- **Site Details Panel**: Displays selected site information including:
  - Site name and location
  - Technology type
  - Status indicators
  - Active alerts
  - Pending tasks
- **Search & Filter**: 
  - Geographic search
  - Technology type filtering
  - Status filtering
  - Saved searches functionality
- **Real-time Components**:
  - Notifications panel with badge counter
  - Connection status indicator
  - Real-time alert visualization
  - Simulation controls for testing
- **Context Providers**:
  - SocketContext for managing Socket.io connections
  - Notification management (read/unread, clear)

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/cell-sites`: Get all cell sites
  - `/api/cell-sites/:id`: Get specific site details
  - `/api/cell-sites/search`: Search cell sites with filters
  - `/api/saved-searches`: Manage saved searches
  - `/api/simulation/start`: Start real-time update simulation
- **Socket.io Events**:
  - `cell_site_updated`: Emitted when a cell site is updated
  - `cell_site_alert`: Emitted when a new alert is generated
  - `cell_site_status_change`: Emitted when a site's status changes
  - `saved_search_updated`: Emitted when a saved search is updated
  - `system_notification`: Emitted for system-wide notifications
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geographic queries
- **Caching**: Redis for API response caching
