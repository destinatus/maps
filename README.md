An interactive web application for visualizing and managing cellular tower sites across the US with real-time updates, filtering capabilities, and detailed site information.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: Visualize 200,000+ cell sites with technology-specific icons
- **Real-time Updates**: Receive instant notifications for site status changes and alerts
- **Advanced Search & Filtering**: Filter by technology type, status, and location
- **Detailed Site Information**: View comprehensive details for each cell site
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Cross-browser Compatible**: Works on all modern browsers
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles large datasets efficiently

## Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- Interactive Leaflet map with clustering for large datasets
- Real-time notifications using Socket.io
- Responsive UI with mobile-first design
- Browser compatibility detection and fixes

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval and management
- Socket.io for real-time event broadcasting
- PostgreSQL database with PostGIS for geographic queries
- Redis caching for improved performance

## Test Coverage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or higher
- PostgreSQL 14.x with PostGIS extension
- Redis 6.x or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose (optional)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cell-site-mapping.git
   cd cell-site-mapping
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   # Install server dependencies
   cd server
   npm install

   # Install client dependencies
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Using Docker
   docker-compose up -d

   # Or manually configure PostgreSQL and Redis
   # See docker-compose.yml for configuration details
   ```

4. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run init-db
   ```

5. Start the application:
   ```bash
   # Start the server
   cd server
   npm start

   # In a separate terminal, start the client
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests and generate coverage reports and badges
npm test

# Or run tests individually:

# Run server tests
cd server
npm test

# Run client tests
cd client
npm test

# Generate coverage reports
cd client
npm run test:coverage

cd server
npm run test:coverage

# Generate placeholder badges (for development)
npm run test:badges

# Check if all required dependencies are installed
npm run check-deps
```

The test coverage reports will be available at:
- Client: `client/coverage/index.html`
- Server: `server/coverage/lcov-report/index.html`

## Load Testing

The application includes a load testing script to simulate 200,000 cell sites:

```bash
cd server
node scripts/load-test.js
```

This will:
1. Generate 200,000 random cell sites
2. Benchmark API performance
3. Test real-time update capabilities
4. Export detailed test results

## Browser Compatibility

The application is tested and optimized for:

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+ (Chromium-based)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
